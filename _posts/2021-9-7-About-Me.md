# About Me

I currently work with Prof. Chih-Yu Wang as a Research Assitant at [Research Center for Information Technology Innovation, Academia Sinica, Taiwan](https://www.citi.sinica.edu.tw/). I have broad interests in **Wireless Communication** and **Networking**. In particular, I am interested in their intersections with **IoT** and **Edge Computing**.
