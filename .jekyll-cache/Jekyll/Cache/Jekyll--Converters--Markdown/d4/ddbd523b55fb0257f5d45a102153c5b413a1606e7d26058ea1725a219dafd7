  <li>Easily scalable text and component sizing with <code>rem</code> units in the CSS</li>
  <li>Support for a wide gamut of HTML elements</li>
  <li>Related posts (time-based, because Jekyll) below each post</li>
  <li>Syntax highlighting, courtesy Pygments (the Python-based code snippet highlighter)</li>
